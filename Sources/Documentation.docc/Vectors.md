# Vectors

## Overview

Apple provides [SIMD vectors](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/simd-vector-types) as generic structures.  The code that would make them conform to this package's [`FloatingPointVector`](doc:FloatingPointVector) protocol is collected in the `VectorRequirements` of the corresponding [`FloatingPointScalar`](doc:FloatingPointScalar) type.
